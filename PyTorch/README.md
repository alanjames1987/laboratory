# Directories

There are three directories, `Code`, `Data`, and `Jupyter` .

`Data` contains any CSVs or other data that will be used for training.

`Code` (hopefully) has production ready code.

`Jupyter` contains a Jupyter notebook that has experiments and quick ideas.

# Code 

Python 3 should be used to run this code.

## Sublime Autocomplete

The best package I've been able to find to work with PyTorch is SublimeJEDI.
